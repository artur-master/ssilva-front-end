## Requirements

- Nodejs

## Setup packages  

- Run `npm install` in order to install dependencies. 
- Open file `.env`, change `API_ROOT` to base API endpoint. 

## Development  

```npm run start```

Starts the development server running on http://localhost:3000

## Generators  

```npm run generate```

Allows you to auto-generate boilerplate code for common parts of your application, specifically components, and containers. You can also run npm run generate <part> to skip the first selection. (e.g. npm run generate container)

## Building  

```npm run build```

Preps your app for deployment (does not run tests). Optimizes and minifies all files, piping them to the build folder.

Upload the contents of build to your web server to see your work live!
